# Contact page + AI Chatbot (black background)

This package contains two pages:

- **index.html** — a black-background contact page with three buttons:
  1. Book an introduction (Calendly)
  2. LinkedIn
  3. AI chatbot — links to `chat.html`

- **chat.html** — a full-screen page that loads the Tidio/Lyro widget and auto-opens it.

## Publish on GitHub Pages
1. Upload `index.html` and `chat.html` to the **root** of your repository's `main` branch.
2. In **Settings → Pages**, set **Deploy from a branch**, then **Branch: `main`**, **Folder: `/ (root)`**.
3. Use your site URL: `https://<username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`
   - Contact page: `/` (index.html)
   - Chat page: `/chat.html`

## Embed in Canva
- In your Canva site, go to **Apps → Embed → Website** and paste the desired URL (the contact page or the chat page).
