# Solix AI Assistant – Contact page + Chat (black background)

This package contains two pages:

- **index.html** — black-background landing page with:
  - Book an introduction (Calendly)
  - LinkedIn
  - The **Solix AI Assistant opens automatically** on load (best-effort). A backup link points to `chat.html`.

- **chat.html** — a dedicated full-screen page that loads the assistant and auto-opens it.

## Publish on GitHub Pages
1. Upload `index.html` and `chat.html` to the **root** of your repository's `main` branch.
2. In **Settings → Pages**, set **Deploy from a branch**, then **Branch: `main`**, **Folder: `/ (root)`**.
3. Your URLs:
   - Landing: `https://<username>.github.io/<repo>/`
   - Assistant: `https://<username>.github.io/<repo>/chat.html`

## Embed in Canva
Use **Apps → Embed → Website** and paste either URL.
